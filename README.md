# Predict_Foliar_Disease_Apple_Trees
In this project, I use the Plant Pathology 2020 - FGVC7 Kaggle dataset in which we analyze the distinguish between leaves that are healthy, those which are infected with apple rust, those that have apple scab, and those with more than one disease. The dataset contains different images of apple leaf so we can predict its health. And I use the deep learning CNN model to extract features from the images and it gives me good accuracy.
